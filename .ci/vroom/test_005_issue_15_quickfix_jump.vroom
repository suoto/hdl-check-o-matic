Macro that writes and waits for the save msg (seems needed in some cases)
  @macro (write)
  :write
  ~ ".*".*\swritten (regex)
  @endmacro




Edit a VHD file without any project file. It is expected to run only the static checker
  :SyntasticInfo
I don't want to type the file within vroom, so I'll copy another file :)
  :tabe ../hdlcc_ci/hdl_lib/common_lib/edge_detector.vhd
  > ggVGy
  ~ 112 lines yanked
  :echo delete('source.vhd')
  :tabe source.vhd
  > P
  ~ 112 more lines
  @do (write)

This file has no errors, so the quickfix list must be empty
  :SyntasticCheck
  :lopen
  &
  :lclose

Find where the architecture declaration begins and insert a signal declaration,
which should result in the static checker saying it is not used
  > /^\s*architecture\s\+\w\+\s\+of\s\+\w\+<CR>
  > o signal unused : integer;<ESC>
  @do (write)
  :lopen
  source.vhd|38 col \d+ warning| signal "unused" is never used (regex)

Jump from the quickfix list and check if we move to the line that has the error
  > <CR> (1.0)
  :echom line('.')
  ~ 38
  :echom getline('.')
  ~ ^.*\bsignal unused : integer;\s* (regex)
