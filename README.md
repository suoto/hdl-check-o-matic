vim-hdl is a Vim plugin that uses [`hdlcc`][hdlcc] to provide some helpers to
VHDL development:

* Syntax checking (using
  [third-party-compilers](#supported-third-party-compilers) +
  [Syntastic][Syntastic])
* [Style checking](#style-checking)

## Installation

### [Pathogen][pathogen]

```bash
cd ~/.vim/bundle/
git clone https://github.com/suoto/vim-hdl.git
```

### [Vundle][vundle]

In your .vimrc:

```viml
Plugin 'suoto/vim-hdl'
```

### Notes

* Requires Vim compiled with Python support, plus features needed by
  [Syntastic][Syntastic] itself
* Only tested on Linux with recent Vim versions (7.4+)

---

## Usage

vim-hdl requires a configuration file listing libraries, source files, build
flags, etc. Select the configuration file via

```viml
" Configure the project file
let g:vimhdl_conf_file = '<config/file>'
" Tell Syntastic to use vim-hdl
let g:syntastic_vhdl_checkers = ['vimhdl']
```

See the [wiki](https://github.com/suoto/vim-hdl/wiki#project-file-formats) for
details on how to write it.

Any other [Syntastic][Syntastic] option should work as well.

You can clone [vim-hdl-examples][vim-hdl-examples] repository and try a ready to
use setup.

## Supported third-party compilers

* [Mentor Graphics® ModelSim®][Mentor_msim]
* [ModelSim-Altera® Edition][Altera_msim]
* [GHDL][GHDL]

---

## Style checking

Style checks are independent of a third-party compiler. Checking includes:

* Signal names in lower case
* Constants and generics in upper case
* Unused signals, constants, generics, shared variables, libraries, types and
  attributes
* Comment tags (`FIXME`, `TODO`, `XXX`)

Notice that currently the unused reports has caveats, namely declarations with
the same name inherited from a component, function, procedure, etc. In the
following example, the signal `rdy` won't be reported as unused in spite of the
fact it is not used.

```vhdl
signal rdy, refclk, rst : std_logic;
...

idelay_ctrl_u : idelay_ctrl
    port map (rdy    => open,
              refclk => refclk,
              rst    => rst);
```

## Issues

* [vim-hdl issue tracker][vimhdl_issue_tracker] should be used for bugs, feature
  requests, etc related to the Vim client itself (something that only happens
  with Vim)
* [hdlcc issue tracker][hdlcc_issue_tracker] should be used for bugs, feature
  requests, etc related to the code checker backend.

If unsure, use [vim-hdl issue tracker][vimhdl_issue_tracker], it will be moved to
[hdlcc issue tracker][hdlcc_issue_tracker] if applicable.
